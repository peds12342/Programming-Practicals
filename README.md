# Programming-Practicals
This will contain all 8 weeks of my programming practical work (README will be updated everytime i have made a commit and completed work).

Update- Completed all the basic tasks of week 1 showing the usage of calling functions such as print and very basic calculations using print, also the idea of BIDMAS and how python tackles calculations.

Update 2- Completed all the tasks on week 2, this uses some basic augmented expressions to do basic calculation, introduces data types such as boolean and string, also had an introduction to indexing and splicing and also lists and their uses.

Update 3- Completed all the tasks on week 3, this practicals main focus was on control statements and the use of boolean expressions which python uses to determine true or false, also had a lot of focus on loops and the use of for and while.

Update 4- Completed all the tasks on week 4, the main focus of this practical was importing and defining functions for more specific uses we may have within our code, we also looked at lambda expressions and what they do (lambda expressions are a bit tricky and confusing :/ ).

Update 5- Have now completed all of the week 5 tasks, rest shall be finished later. So far week 5 has been very focused on creating scripts in text files and then activating them in the terminal. We have also began some work on creating our own modules in these text files and then later importing them to a program so it can be used. Due to a majority of these being meant to be used via the command line as a script they may not run correctly on python with the code posted in the week 5 folder. (The rest of the work that was left on the week 5 tasks was similar to the rest i had done involving the command line statements and creating and running our own module and script).
